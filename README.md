# Spyro Model Workspace For SRT
A workspace with exported mesh, animations and Unreal Engine project


Requirements:
**WWise 2018.1.11.6987** with Unreal Engine 4.19 integration or alternatively following modules:
* Apple > macOS
* Microsoft > Windows > Visual Studio 2015
* Microsoft > Windows > Visual Studio 2017

Bugs:
* Not all animations are going to 1:1 due to lack of ability to get additive animations.
* 2D Eyes are currently not animated. One way to overcome this issue is creating 3D eyes and assigning them to their respective eye bones which are correctly animated.

TODO:

* Animate all the additive animations.
* Add all the missing animation notifiers.
* Create a blend file with Spyro's mesh.
* Create 3D eyes or animate 2D eye curves.
